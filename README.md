What is the project? 

It is a A very humble twitter clone a message-board style website. 

How does it work? 

You create an account and can log in to the site. Once you log in you can post tweets on a communal tweet feed. 

Why did I choose it? 

It was a very exciting project to do as I always enjoyed the messageboard plantform concept ever since I was first introduced to it. 

Technical Challenges & Lessons

Technical challenges were many, but there were two main reoccurring technical challenges. First revolved around maintaining a logged in user session. 
Second technical challenge was with API integration. Originally the whole project revolved around an API I could figure out how to use. Once I decided to switch projects to something more familiar. 
It was a lot easier to implement an API as a bonus to the website.

This project was created as a part of the class requirement for Ironhack bootcamp. 

The tech used in this project include: Express.js, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, REST Api
